1.What is prop drilling?

Prop drilling is the process of passing data from a parent component to a deeply nested child component through props. This usually involves passing the data through several layers of components, which can make the code harder to manage and maintain. 

In simpler terms, if you have a parent component that needs to pass data to a grandchild component, it has to pass the data down through each intermediate component.

2. What is lifting the state up?

Lifting state up is the practice of moving state from a child component to a common parent component. This is done to share the state between multiple child components or to manage it in a single place. By lifting the state up, you ensure that all components that need access to the state can get it from their common parent.

3.What are Context Provider and Context Consumer?

**Context Provider** is a component that supplies data (state) to its child components through React's Context API. It defines the value that will be shared across the component tree.

**Context Consumer** is a component that receives and uses the data provided by the Context Provider. It allows components to access the shared data without having to pass it down manually through props.

4.If you don't pass a value to the provider does it take the default value?

Yes, if you donâ€™t pass a value to the Context Provider, it will use the default value specified when the context was created.
