1.Advantages of using Redux Toolkit over Redux

**Redux Toolkit** simplifies Redux development by providing:

- **Less boilerplate**: Automatically generates actions and reducers, reducing manual code.
- **Better defaults**: Includes best practices by default, like using `Immer` for immutability.
- **Simplified configuration**: Built-in tools for store setup, middleware, and state management.
- **Enhanced development experience**: Includes features like `createSlice`, which combines action creators and reducers, and DevTools integration.
- **Built-in thunk support**: Async logic is easier to manage with less setup.

Overall, Redux Toolkit streamlines and enhances the Redux workflow, making it easier and faster to use.

2.Explain Dispatcher.

In Redux, the **dispatcher** is responsible for sending actions to the store. When you **dispatch** an action, you're telling Redux to take that action and update the state accordingly.

In simple terms, **dispatch** is like saying, "Hey Redux, something happened! Here's what it is, now update the state."

Example:
```js
store.dispatch({ type: 'ADD_ITEM', payload: item });
```

Here, `dispatch` is used to send an action that adds an item to the state.

3.Explain Reducer.

A **reducer** in Redux is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as inputs and returns a new state. It decides how the state should change based on the action.

In simple terms, a **reducer** is like a manager that updates the state when an action is dispatched.

Example:
```js
function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_ITEM':
      return { ...state, items: [...state.items, action.payload] };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

Here, the reducer updates the state by adding an item when the `ADD_ITEM` action is dispatched.

4.Explain Slice.

A **slice** in Redux Toolkit is a way to organize state, actions, and reducers together in one place. Each slice represents a "piece" of the state and contains:

- The **initial state** for that piece.
- **Reducers** to update the state.
- **Action creators** that trigger the reducers.

In simple terms, a **slice** is like a small, self-contained part of your app's state with its own logic.

Example:
```js
const itemsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'items',
  initialState: [],
  reducers: {
    addItem: (state, action) => {
      state.push(action.payload);
    },
  },
});
```

This slice has an `addItem` action and a reducer to handle adding items to the state.

5. Explain Selector.

A **selector** in Redux is a function that extracts or retrieves a specific part of the state from the store. It helps you get the data you need from the global state without having to directly access the entire state object.

In simple terms, a **selector** is like a shortcut to grab specific data from the Redux store.

Example:
```js
const selectItems = (state) => state.items;
```

Here, `selectItems` is a selector that retrieves the `items` part of the state.

6.Explain createSlice and the configuration it takes.

`createSlice` is a function from Redux Toolkit that simplifies creating a slice of your Redux store. It automatically generates actions and reducers for you based on the configuration you provide.

**Configuration for `createSlice`:**
- **`name`**: A unique name for the slice.
- **`initialState`**: The initial state for this slice.
- **`reducers`**: An object where each key is a reducer function for handling actions related to this slice.

Example:
```js
const itemsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'items',
  initialState: [],
  reducers: {
    addItem: (state, action) => {
      state.push(action.payload);
    },
    removeItem: (state, action) => {
      return state.filter(item => item.id !== action.payload.id);
    },
  },
});
```

Here, `createSlice` automatically generates action creators (`addItem`, `removeItem`) and their corresponding reducers based on the configuration.
