1.What is `Microservice`?

A microservice is a small, independent service that performs a specific function and communicates with other services through lightweight mechanisms, like HTTP APIs. This approach enables flexibility, scalability, and easier management of complex applications.

2.What is `Monolith architecture`?

Monolithic architecture is a software design where all components and services of an application are integrated and operate as a single unit. This approach means that the entire application is developed, deployed, and scaled as one large block of code.

3.What is the `difference` between `Monolith and Microservice?

Monolithic architecture combines all application components into a single unit, making them interdependent. In contrast, microservices architecture splits the application into independent, smaller services, allowing each to be developed, deployed, and scaled separately.

4.Why do we need a `useEffect Hook`?

The `useEffect` Hook is needed in React to perform side effects in function components, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or manually updating the DOM. It helps ensure these actions are executed at the right time in the component lifecycle.

5. What is `Optional Chaining`?

Optional chaining is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to safely access nested object properties without worrying about null or undefined values, preventing errors if a property doesn’t exist.

6.What is `Shimmer UI`?

Shimmer UI is a design technique used in applications to show loading placeholders that mimic the structure of the actual content, creating a shimmering or gradient effect that indicates data is being loaded, enhancing the user experience during delays.

7.What is the `difference` between `JS expression and JS statement`?

A JavaScript expression evaluates to a value, like `5 + 3` or `x > 0`. A JavaScript statement performs an action, like declaring a variable (`let x = 5;`) or making a decision (`if (x > 0) {}`), and doesn’t necessarily produce a value.

8.What is `Conditional Rendering`? explain with a code example.

Conditional rendering in React means displaying different components or elements based on certain conditions. Here’s a simple example:

```jsx
function Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please sign in.</h1>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `<Greeting>` component checks the `isLoggedIn` prop and renders a welcome message if true, or a sign-in prompt if false.

9.What is `CORS`?

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature in web browsers that controls how web pages can request resources from different domains. It helps prevent unauthorized access to resources on different origins.

10.What is `async and await`?

`async` and `await` are JavaScript features for working with asynchronous code. `async` makes a function return a promise, and `await` pauses the function execution until the promise resolves, allowing you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous.

11.What is the use of `const json = await data.json()`; in `getRestaurants()`?

In `getRestaurants()`, `const json = await data.json();` converts the response from a fetch request into a JavaScript object, allowing you to work with the data more easily.
